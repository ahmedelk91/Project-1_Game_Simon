SUPREME LEADER AHMED SAYS | THE GAME

Year 3016 AD. Climate change has plunged the world into a dystopian society where the incredibly handsome and buff yet ruthless leader Ahmed rules the land! If you can follow Ahmed's ridiculous demands, you can reclaim humanity's future. WILL YOU LEAD THE RESISTANCE?!

Instructions

1) Press start to initiate the game

2) Colored circles will light up in a pattern

3) Click the colored circles to match Ahmed's pattern

4) If you don't match the pattern, you lose

5) If you can match 20 patterns, you free mankind (TBD)

This project makes use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

For a future iteration I will be adding the following:

+ High score function
+ Timer
+ Reposition circles into a grid
+ Sound effects for sequence and player input
+ Increased speed
+ Easy, Medium, and Hard settings
