  <!-- User Story

  As a user:
  -I want to have a title displayed so I know what game I am playing.
  -I want to have the instructions laid out on the same page so I know how to play.
  -I want to click a start button so the sequence begins.
  -I want the game to generate random sequences so I can mimick them.
  -I want the sequences to increase in speed and difficulty after every input so I can be challenged.
  -I want to click the circles so that it lights up.
  -I want my click patterns to be recorded so that another sequence can follow.
  -I want to see my score after each sequence so I know how I am doing in real time.
  -I want the game to restart if I mess up a sequence so I can play again.
  -I want my score to be recorded so I can compare it to previous scores.

  Code Story
  -The page loads
  -Title, Instructions, a start button, and 4 circle Divs appear
  -.on("click", function(evt){
  *TBD*
} the start button is pressed, the divs will light up in a sequence.
-The game will start off with begginer level difficulty.
-After the sequence is initiated
setInterval(change color on random div, every 2 seconds){
*TBD*
}
,prompt(a message will appear saying "Your Turn")
-The player will click the divs that match the the light sequence. .on(click, match sequence)
-If the player is succesful in matching the light sequence, the game will generate another random sequence at an increased speed and complexity. for(i=0,i<10,i++)
-If the player enters an incorrect sequence, the game will end and a score will be recorded.
if (sequence === comupter sequence) {
continue sequence with higher frequency and complexity
} else {
prompt.("YOU LOSE!")
});
-The game will reload.
